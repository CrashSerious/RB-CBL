====================================================

** THIS IS ONLY FOR THE e200r(RHAPSODY) VERSION **
** You will first need to patch your bootloader. **
** If you have already patched your bootloader, then skip to STEP 2 **

STEP 1:

Follow the instructions posted here to patch your e200r bootloader:
http://www.rockbox.org/wiki/SansaE200RInstallation

STEP 2:

** ONLY After Patching your e200r bootloader proceed with the next steps **

1. Download a Sansa e200 build (v1 only) of Rockbox and unzip it to the root of your device.
   Daily build can be downloaded here: http://build.rockbox.org/data/rockbox-sansae200.zip 
2. Download the compiled CBL zip file and extract it somewhere on your computer.
3. Boot up your e200r into the OF by holding the left button while powering up.
4. Connect the USB cable.
5. Open up the folder where you extracted the files.
6. Copy OF.mi4 from the extracted e200r directory to the /System directory on your Sansa.
   NOTE: the /System directory is hidden, so make sure your folder settings allow viewing
         hidden files and folder.
7. Copy pp5022.mi4 from the extracted e200r directory to the root of your device.
8. Copy cbl.cfg from the extracted e200r directory to the root of your Sansa.

 ** TO UPDATE the e200r Custom Bootloader:
----------------------------------------------------

2. Copy pp5022.mi4 from the extracted e200r directory to the root of your device.
3. Safely remove your device and press and continue holding the left button while you 
   disconnect the USB cable so that the device reboots into the OF.

====================================================
 Notes:
====================================================

* The LEFT button is reserved for booting into the Original Sansa firmware, same as always.
* rockbox.mi4 (used as the default firmware) — If you are already running a custom FW, I'd
  suggest renaming the .mi4 file something else and recording it in your cbl.cfg file.
  Then reinstall RB so that rockbox.mi4 is the original RB firmware.
* If you try to boot up a non-existent firmware image, the bootloader will let you know 
  it was not loaded and proceed to load the default firmware.
* If the config file (cbl.cfg) is not found it will use the default settings.
  Defaults are: UP.mi4, DOWN.mi4, RIGHT.mi4, SELECT.mi4
* Use "#" to comment out a line. If the variable isn't set, the default will be used
  for that button or firmware dir.
* If the firmware is found and loaded correctly, you should see a confirmation 
  “*** Firmware Loaded ***” message.
